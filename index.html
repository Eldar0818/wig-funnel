                    <h2>Choose the Right Color</h2>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Avoid Going Too Dark: Dark hair can sometimes make features look harsher or older. Opt for a color that's slightly lighter than your natural hair, or try a soft balayage or highlights to add dimension.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Consider Warm Tones: Warmer shades like honey blondes, caramel browns, or golden highlights can give a softer, more vibrant look. Cool tones may work as well, but they should complement skin undertones to avoid looking washed out.</p>

                    <h2>Select a Flattering Length</h2>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Shoulder-Length or Just Below: Mid-length wigs are universally flattering and generally make people look younger. They offer a bit of bounce without being weighed down, creating a fresh look.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Short Styles: For a more daring look, short styles like bobs or pixie cuts often look youthful, especially with soft layers that frame the face.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Avoid Extreme Lengths: Very long wigs can sometimes pull the face down or make the overall look appear less polished.</p>

                    <h2>Consider Face-Framing Bangs</h2>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Side-Swept or Wispy Bangs: Bangs can do wonders for adding a youthful look, especially when they frame the face softly. Side-swept bangs or soft, wispy bangs give a fresh look without being heavy.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Avoid Heavy, Straight Bangs: Thick, straight-across bangs can be harder to pull off and may look less natural. Go for softer, feathered options.</p>

                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Opt for Realistic Fiber or Human Hair: Synthetic wigs with a realistic texture or, if possible, human hair wigs can give a more natural appearance. Avoid overly shiny wigs, as they can look unnatural.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Lace Fronts for a Natural Hairline: A lace front wig allows for a more natural-looking hairline and adds to the youthful effect by creating the illusion of real hair.</p>

                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Layers add texture and movement, which can make hair look fuller and more youthful. Aim for soft, subtle layers that frame the face. Avoid styles that are overly blunt or flat, as they can age the face.</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-tag"></i> Sometimes experimenting with a few different looks can help narrow down which styles work best for a fresh look. Try a few styles in front of the mirror, or use apps that allow you to ‚Äútry on‚Äù different wigs virtually.</p>
